Python program that uses the Spotipy library to read in a list of artists and generates a playlist of their top 5 songs.

Example lineup.txt file is provided, any size list should work just format as one artist per line

Put lineup.txt in the same folder as the program

Run the program like so: python FestivalLister.py *username* *playlistURI*

Of course you will need to set your spotify developer credentials first. 

Note - this program is not perfect but it works well enough.
